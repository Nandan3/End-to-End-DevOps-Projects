Set up CICD pipeline using Github Actions and GitOps approach (ArgoCD):

Built Continuous Integration pipeline using Github Actions:

Write a ci.yaml file under .github/worflows/ directory
Link of the file: https://github.com/Nandan3/End-to-End-DevOps-Projects/tree/main/.github/workflow

Create a new git branch in CLI
$git checkout -b cicheck
Switched to a new branch 'cicheck'
Modify main.go file in product-catalog directory

Built Continuous Deployment pipeline using GitOps approach:

Why ArgoCD is preferred over other tools (like Ansible, shell scripting, python using helm)

Constant monitoring and automatic deployment to K8s cluster Reconciliation of state: if any changes made in k8s cluster directly argoCD removes it and fix it into previous version. (version control system is the source of truth)
