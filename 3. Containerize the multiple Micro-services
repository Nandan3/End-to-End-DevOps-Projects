🎯 Containerize the multiple Micro-services using Dockerfiles:
	
This is an e-commerce based application, which contains multiple micro-services. Each micro-services are developed using different programming languages. For example

	1. Product-catalogue service: Go lang
	2. Ad service: Java
	3. Recommendation service: Python
	
So I took 3 micro-services from different programming language, where I containerize the micro-services using Dockerfile and build the images.

Product-catalog service: (Go programming language)
	1. $sudo apt install golang-go     
	2. Files: go.mod & go.sum - takes care of dependencies
	
	Build the service in local using below steps:
		a. $export PRODUCT_CATALOG_PORT=8088
		b. $go build -o product-catalog .
		c. $./product-catalog
		
		O/P:
		INFO[0000] Loaded 10 products
		INFO[0000] Product Catalog gRPC server started on port: 8088
	
	Run the below commands to build the image and to run the container:
		a. $docker build -t nandandocker07/product-catalog:v1 .
		
		-t >> tag (docker-hub-user)/repo-name:version
		. >> location of dockerfile
		
		b. $docker run nandandocker07/product-catalog:v1
		
Ad-service: (Java programming language)
	1. Build using gradle or maven
	2. File: gradlew (gradle wrapper for Linux & Mac) or gradlew.bat (for windows) takes care of dependencies.
	File: pom.xml (take care of dependencies in case of maven)
	
	Build the service in local using below steps:
		a. Install java:
		$sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre-headless
		b. Give permission to gradlew file
		$chmod +x gradlew
		c. Run the below command:
		$./gradlew installDist
			
			ü Start the gradle daemon, which is like a server
			ü Install the dependencies 
			ü Perform code compilation 
			ü Build the application and stored in perticular directory
	
	Run the below commands to build the image and to run the container:
		a. $docker build -t nandandocker07/ad-service:v1 .
	
		b. $docker run nandandocker07/ad-service:v1
		
Recommendation service: (Python programming language)
	1. File: requirments.txt take care of dependencies
	
	Run the below commands to build the image and to run the container:
		a. $docker build -t nandandocker07/recommandation-service:v1 .

		b. $docker run nandandocker07/recommandation-service:v1
		
Push the docker images into docker hub: (registry or container artifactory)
	1. Registries are: dockerhub, quay.io, ECR, ACR, GHCR
	
	2. First login to registry where you want to push the image
	Eg:
	$docker login docker.io
	$docker login quay.io
	$docker login ARN <URL/Num>         #AWS
	
	3. Push the image using below command
	$docker tag docker.io/nandandocker07/product-catalog:v1
	$docker push docker.io/nandandocker07/product-catalog:v1
	
	docker.io >> docker hub registry
	nandandocker07 >> registry user name
	product-catalog >> repo name
	:v1 >> tag of the image
	
Preparation of docker-compose file to run the entire environment:
	1. Main components of docker-compose.yml
		ü Service object >> define how to pull or run the micro-services
		ü Network object >> create network for all micro-services
		ü Volume object
	
	2. You will find the docker-compose.yaml file in my github repository
	Link: https://github.com/Nandan3/End-to-End-DevOps-Projects/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml
	
	3. Run the application using docker compose commands
	$docker compose up -d
	
	Access the application using: http://<public-ip>:8080
	Public-IP: EC2 Public IP
