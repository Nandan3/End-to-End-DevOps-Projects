Follow the steps below:

	§ Create EC2 Instance:
	type: t2.large
	storage: 30GB
	
	
	
	§ Resize File system: (if running out of space while creating the application)
		1. Increase the instance volume to 30GB
		
		
		
		2. Change the file system in CLI
		 $lsblk
		
		
		$sudo apt install cloud-guest-utils
		$sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
		$sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1
	
	§ If you face any issue related to "permission denied", while executing the docker commands. Add the user to docker group using:
	$sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
	
	§ Running the application local environment using docker compose:
	
	Why docker compose?
	I'm deploying e-commerce application, which contains multiple micro-services. So we containerize and running as one model using docker compose is efficient.
	It runs multiple containers at once and establish the dependencies between the containers.
	
	You will find the docker-compose.yaml file in my github repository
	Link: https://github.com/Nandan3/End-to-End-DevOps-Projects/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml
	
	Run the below command
	$docker compose up -d
	
	Edit security groups inbound rules to access the application from web browser
		
	Access the application using: http://<public-ip>:8080
	Public-IP: EC2 Public IP
